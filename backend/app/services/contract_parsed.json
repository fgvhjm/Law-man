CONSULTANT may maintain the required post agreement coverage by renewal or purchase of prior acts or tail coverage.  This provision is contingent upon post agreement coverage being both available and reasonably affordable in relation to the coverage provided during the term of this Agreement.  For purposes of interpreting this requirement, a cost not exceeding 100% of the last annual policy premium during the term of this Agreement in order to purchase prior acts or tail coverage for post agreement coverage shall be deemed to be reasonable. The COMMISSION will not be responsible for any premiums or assessments on the policy.\n- 2) All required Automobile and Comprehensive or Commercial General Liability Insurance shall be endorsed to contain the following clause:\n'Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, its officials, employees, agents and volunteers are added as an additional insured as respects the operations and activities of, or on behalf of, the named insured performed under Agreement with the Commission.'\n- 3) All required insurance policies shall be endorsed to contain the following clause: 'This insurance shall not be canceled until after thirty (30) days prior written notice has been given to:\nSanta Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission Attn: Yesenia Parra 1523 Pacific Avenue Santa Cruz, CA 95060\n- 4) CONSULTANT agrees to provide its insurance broker(s) with a full copy of these insurance provisions and provide COMMISSION on or before the effective date of this Agreement with Certificates of Insurance for all required coverages.

In the event said insurance coverage expires at any time or times during the term of this contract, the CONSULTANT agrees to provide at least thirty (30) days prior notice to said expiration date; and a new Certificate of Insurance evidencing insurance coverage as provided for herein, for not less than either the remainder of the term of the contract, or for a period of not less than one (1) year. New Certificates of Insurance are subject to the approval of the COMMISSION.  In the event the CONSULTANT fails to keep in effect at all times insurance\ncoverage as herein provided, the COMMISSION may, in addition to any other remedies it may have, terminate this Agreement  upon occurrence of such event.\n- 6) If any insurance policy of CONSULTANT required by this document includes language conditioning the insurer's legal obligation to defend or indemnify COMMISSION on the performance of any act(s) by the named insured, then said insurance policy, by endorsement, shall also name the COMMISSION as a named insured. Notwithstanding the foregoing, both the CONSULTANT and its insurers agree that by naming the COMMISSION as a named insured, the COMMISSION may at its sole direction, but is not obligated to, perform any act required by the named insured under said insurance policies.\n- 7) CONSULTANT shall do all things required to be performed by it pursuant to its insurance policies including but not limited to paying within five (5) work days, all deductibles and self-insured retentions (SIR) required to be paid under any insurance policy that may provide defense or indemnity coverage to COMMISSION or any additional insured.\n- 8) CONSULTANT shall cause the foregoing provisions to be inserted in all subcontracts for any work covered under this Agreement by a subconsultant compensated more than $50,000 and employing more than fifteen (15) employees, provided that the foregoing provisions shall not apply to contracts or subcontracts for standard commercial supplies or raw materials.\n7.

INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT STATUS . CONSULTANT and COMMISSION have reviewed and considered the principal test and secondary factors herein and agree that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT and not an employee of COMMISSION. CONSULTANT is responsible for all insurance (workers compensation, unemployment, etc.) and all payroll related taxes.  CONSULTANT is not entitled to any employee benefits.  COMMISSION agrees that CONSULTANT shall have the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for herein.\nPRINCIPAL TEST: The CONSULTANT rather than COMMISSION has the right to control the manner and means of accomplishing the result contracted for.\nSECONDARY FACTORS: (a) The extent of control which, by agreement, COMMISSION may exercise over the details of the work is slight rather than substantial; (b) CONSULTANT is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (c) In the locality, the work to be done by CONSULTANT is usually done by a specialist without supervision, rather than under the direction of an employer; (d) The skill required in the particular occupation is substantial rather than slight; (e) The CONSULTANT rather than the COMMISSION supplies the instrumentalities, tools and work place; (f) The length of time for which CONSULTANT is engaged is of limited duration rather than indefinite; (g) The method of payment of CONSULTANT is by the job rather than by the time; (h) The work is part of a special or permissive activity, program, or project, rather than part of the regular business of COMMISSION; (i) CONSULTANT and COMMISSION believe they are creating an independent CONSULTANT relationship rather than an employer-employee relationship; and (j) The COMMISSION conducts public business.\nIt is recognized that it is not necessary that all secondary factors support creation of an independent CONSULTANT relationship, but rather that overall there are significant secondary factors which indicate that CONSULTANT is an independent CONSULTANT.\nBy their signatures to this Agreement, each of the undersigned certifies that it is his or her considered judgment that the CONSULTANT engaged under this Agreement is in fact an independent CONSULTANT.\n12. RETENTION AND AUDIT OF RECORDS . For the purpose of determining compliance with Public Contract Code 10115, et seq. and Title 21, California Code of Regulations, Chapter 21, Section 2500 et seq., if applicable and other matters connected with the performance of the contract pursuant to Government Code 8546.7: CONSULTANT, subconsultants, and the COMMISSION shall maintain all books, documents, papers, accounting records, and other evidence pertaining to the performance of the contract, including but\nnot limited to, the costs of administering the Agreement.
